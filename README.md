# Tic-Tac-Toe ReadMe
## *Instructions*
### Launching
 - Locate the executable application
 - Double-click on the executable (.exe)
### Playing the Game: Controls
 - You must click "Enter" to confirm each choice.
 - When starting the game, you will be asked whether or not you would like to play a one player or two player game. Typing "1" will start a one player game. Typing "2" will start a two player game.
 - During your turn, you will be asked where you would like to put your mark ("X" for player 1, "O" for player 2). The numbers on the sample board provided at the beginning of the game correlate with the keys on your keyboard. For example, if you type "8", the spot with the "8" on the sample board will have your mark in it.
 - At the end of the game, you will be asked if you want to restart. Typing if you type "1", the game will restart to the game selection prompt. If you type "2", it will quit the game and the application will close.
## *Rules*
 - The object of the game is to get three marks ("X" or "O") in a row. There are a total of 8 different winning combinations. For example;
 
 X X ==O==
 
 X ==O== O
 
 ==O== X X
 
 or
 
 X O ==X==
 
 O O ==X==
 
 O X ==X==
 
 - Players take turns putting their own marks down in unused space on the board. The first with three marks in a row wins. 
 - If no player wins and there are no empty spaces left, the game ends in a tie.
